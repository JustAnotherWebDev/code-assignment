# Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Get Started

1. `git clone https://github.com/JustAnotherWebDev/code-assignment.git` to clone the app
2. `cd .\code-assignment\` to change directory
3. `npm install` to install all node modules
4. `npm run start` to run the app in development mode

## Requirements

- The application must be created with `create-react-app` in JavaScript or TypeScript
- There must be a `README.md` file explaining how to run it
- The application is a single page containing only a table that displays the data:
  - The table MUST NOT BE an existing npm package that implements table-like features (e.g. react-table) but it must be written from scratch
  - All the columns must be sortable
- The data must not be embedded in the application, it must be fetch on-the-fly
